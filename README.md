### Project Description
Mood Spoiler is an AI-powered chat app that uses your webcam to guess your real emotion‚Äîthen responds with the exact opposite mood, spiced with humor or sarcasm! Try to be happy? It‚Äôll bring the rain! Feeling sad? It‚Äôll annoy you with cheer.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many chatbots are supportive, positive, or logical. But what about those times you need your happiness ruined, or your sadness mocked? Sometimes, we just crave a villain to spoil our mood for no reason at all.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Mood Spoiler Bot! Uses AI and real-time facial detection to sense your feelings and‚Äîout of pure mischief‚Äîserve responses that are 100% the opposite. Happy? Prepare to be grumpy. Sad? We‚Äôre sending confetti... sarcastically!
